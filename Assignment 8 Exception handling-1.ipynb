    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python generates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as its type and details about where it occurred in the code. This exception object can be caught and handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing and to provide more meaningful error messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common types of exceptions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "->SyntaxError: These are errors that occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid syntax in your code. They typically prevent the program from running at all. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis or use an undefined variable, you'll get a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "->ZeroDivisionError: This exception occurs when you try to divide a number by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "->FileNotFoundError: Raised when an attempt to open a file fails because the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "->IndexError: Raised when you try to access an index that is out of range in a list or other sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "->TypeError: Occurs when you perform an operation on a data type that is not supported, such as trying to add a string and an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "->ValueError: Raised when you provide an argument of the correct data type but with an invalid value, such as trying to convert a string that cannot be parsed into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's discuss the difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nature of Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "->Exceptions: Exceptions are runtime errors that occur when the program is executed. They can happen even if the code's syntax is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Syntax Errors: Syntax errors are compile-time errors that occur when the code is being parsed by the Python interpreter before execution. These errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "->Exceptions: They occur during program execution when a specific condition is met, causing the program to deviate from its normal flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Syntax Errors: They are detected during the parsing phase before the program begins execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "->Exceptions: You can catch and handle exceptions using try-except blocks to gracefully deal with unexpected issues in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Syntax Errors: You need to fix syntax errors before you can even run the program; they cannot be caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n"

If the exception reaches the top-level without being caught and handled, it will result in the program terminating, and Python will display an error message that includes information about the unhandled exception.\n"
